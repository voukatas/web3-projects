# Web3 Projects

This repository contains various projects focused on Web3 development, particularly on the Ethereum blockchain.
These projects aim to demonstrate different aspects of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and blockchain interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. A code editor like VSCode.
3. MetaMask or another web3 provider set up in your browser. This will allow you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Make sure to set your MetaMask wallet to the Sepolia test network for certain projects like MoodContract.

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory of your choice, then install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/voukatas/web3-projects.git
cd web3-projects/[project-directory]
npm install
```

Sepolia Testnet Tokens
If you're working on the Sepolia testnet, you may need some testnet ETH to deploy contracts or interact with existing ones. You can request Sepolia testnet tokens from the following faucets:
- [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)
- [QuickNode Sepolia Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

# Demo Projects
